\alias{calc_light_attr}
\title{Calculate the diffuse and direct components of solar radiation and solar position}
\usage{
calc_light_attr(datetime, globrad, lat, lon)
}
\arguments{
\item{datetime}{Single or multiple DateTime. Can be a character in UTC (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss) or a POSIXct}

\item{globrad}{Incoming global radiation in W m-2. Its length should match length of \code{datetime}.}

\item{lat}{Latitude of the field in °}

\item{lon}{Longitude of the field in °}
}
\value{
A tibble with:
\itemize{
\item datetime: DateTime object
\item globrad: global radiation in W m-2
\item frac_diff: fraction of diffuse light in global radiation (0-1)
\item rad_diff: diffuse component of global radiation in W m-2
\item rad_dir: direct component of global radiation in W m-2
\item theta: sun angle from the zenith in radians (0 at the zenith and PI/2 at the horizon)
\item phi: sun azimuth in radians (direction along the horizon, measured from north to east), e.g. 0 is north and \eqn{\frac{\pi}{4}} northeast
}
